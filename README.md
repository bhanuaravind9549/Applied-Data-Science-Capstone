# Data Science Capstone Project

**Part of [IBM Applied Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone?specialization=ibm-data-science)**

In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this lab, you will collect and make sure the data is in the correct format from an API. The following is an example of a successful and launch.

## Problems you want to find answers.

- Determined the price of each launch.
- Predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.

## Objective
- Writing Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas data frame.
- Conversion of a JSON file into a Create a Python Pandas data frame by converting a JSON file.
- Using data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem.
- Using your data analysis tools to load a dataset, clean it, and find out interesting insights from it.
